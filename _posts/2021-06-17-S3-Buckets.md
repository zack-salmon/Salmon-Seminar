What do buckets, clouds, and the letter S all have in common? Why they're part of Amazon's Web Services of course! Ok that was a stupid joke I get it, but Amazon has combined these into some very useful tools for development and hosting websites. An S3 Bucket, one of Amazon's services, can be used to store your website's code and host them at the same time. The way that this is done is simple. Upload your code to your S3 Bucket of choice.
