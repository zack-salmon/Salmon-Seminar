Lambda functions, at their core, are just that. Functions. Or a collection of functions that you can call from your code or other events, and they will do some function stuff and spit out a response that you can then use for your various other needs within your code. Then why, you might be asking, should I use them over a function I already have in my code? What is the benefit? Well I'm glad you asked!

Because a Lambda functions are billed by Amazon for the amount of time spent executing, rather than the space that it takes up. What this means is, if you have a large function, but it is only called minimally within your code, then you may be able to save money by placing it in a Lambda because Amazon will only charge you for when it actually runs and how long it runs for. 

Lambda functions can be called by various events within the AWS ecosystem as well. A major one is Amazon's EventBridge. EventBridge allows you to set up events and rules for what happens when those events are triggered. For instance, every five minutes a Lambda function can be triggered by that event.
