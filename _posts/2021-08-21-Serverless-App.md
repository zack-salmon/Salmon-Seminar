Serverless is the new hot craze, and potentially rightfully so. Serverless apps allow some other entity to do all the hard work of hosting, and running your code so you don't have to. This does mean, however, that some control gets lost in the process. You are allowing someone else to run the servers for you, and it is sometimes out of your hands as to whether certain things work as expected.
